# SDL2 Engine

This is currently a very simple implementation of SDL2 in a very bare bones state.

## Current documentation

Obviously this is a SDL2 based engine, that's main focus is multiplayer.

We have gravity, velocity, and soon collision.

You can login to the server and connect and just jump around and shoot things (currently).
